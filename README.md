# Random jokes

It was a study project on [RSSchool Stage0](https://rs.school/js-stage0/) course. Task link [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/js30%23/js30-4.md)<br>
<br>During a week we created an app in private repository, which is getting data from JSON-file.<br><br>
The task took about 2 days. In [the result](https://pesukarhutg.github.io/random-jokes/) you can see the adaptive app, which can get you a funny day prediction. <br><br>
